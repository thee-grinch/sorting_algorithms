## Tasks

1. [Bubble sort](0-bubble_sort.c)
    - We wrote a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
    - We printed the array after each swap operation.
    - We calculated the Big O notation for the time complexity of Bubble Sort.

2. [Insertion sort](1-insertion_sort_list.c)
    - We wrote a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
    - We printed the list after each swap operation.
    - We determined the Big O notation for the time complexity of Insertion Sort.

3. [Selection sort](2-selection_sort.c)
    - We implemented a function to sort an array of integers using the Selection sort algorithm.
    - We printed the array after each swap.
    - We analyzed the Big O notation for the time complexity of Selection Sort.

4. [Quick sort](3-quick_sort.c)
    - We created a function to sort an array of integers using the Quick sort algorithm with the Lomuto partition scheme.
    - We printed the array after each swap operation.
    - We determined the Big O notation for the time complexity of Quick Sort.
